            Hi there, my name is Supreeth Mysore Venkatesh.<br><br>
    
                I am a PhD researcher specializing in Quantum AI with a strong background in both academia 
                and industry. My current research focuses on developing advanced algorithms for computationally intensive 
                problems, with practical applications in satellite data analysis and management.<br><br>
                
                I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Saarland University, Germany. My Master's thesis involved development of 
                novel quantum algorithms for NP-hard problems, some of which are currently used by major companies. My Bachelor's degree 
                in Information Science and Engineering from the National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru, India laid the foundation for my career.<br><br>
                
                I have 7+ years of professional experience contributing to all parts of a techstack. Starting as a software intern at motorola where I 
                contributed to data pipeline automation, and then served as a software developer at Infineon Technologies. My industrial experience also 
                includes roles as a Junior Researcher in machine learning, where I was involved in data analysis, visualization, training ML models, 
                deploying microservices, providing inference as API services and setting-up CI/CD pipelines.
